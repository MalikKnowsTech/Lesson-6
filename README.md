# Lesson-6 Images

In this lesson I learned about:

- how to add images to your website
- best practice: enter the width and height of the image (can be found in at the bottom of VS code)
- "src" (source) attribute is used to link the image to your html code
- "alt" attribute is used by text to speech software (like AWS Polly) and can be viewed:
     -if the image breaks
     -by hovering mouse over the image
-"figure" element can be used to specify content 
-figcaption tells the broweser and assistive tech that the text there is related to that image


-use "lazy" loading to stop images from loading before they are actually viewed (faster processing speeds = reduced loading time
-if it is not specified; loading is "eager" by deafult; loads all images once the website is accessed
